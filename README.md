# FAQ

### Why create this guide?
I mostly created this guide for myself, as anytime I return to networking coding I find myself stuck on issues I knew how to solve before. Rather than wasting time searching for the answer, I wanted a guide not only to help with these issues but to also go from start to finish in getting networking set up. I personally find it easier to go through text then it is to go through video guides.

### Can I help out?
Sure, you can either fork the project and I'll merge your changes or report issues and I'll try to get to them.

### What version of Unity is the project in?
The project was made in 2017.2.2f1, however most of the ideas/scripts in it should work in other versions.
